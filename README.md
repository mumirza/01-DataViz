Data Visualization in Tableau 

I created a time series analysis dashboard using the Texas housing market dataset, which
is designed specifically for real estate investment analysts (see Appendix 1). The dashboard
provides a comprehensive view of market trends and performance indicators such as sales
volume, median prices, and supply and demand dynamics. It also offers filtering capabilities for
specific cities and years to enable a more in-depth analysis of market trends.

I selected line graphs and bar charts for data representation, keeping in mind the target
audience and the structure of variables. Line graphs are preferred by finance industry analysts,
who are skilled at interpreting them. They are especially useful for showing trends over time,
particularly with time series data. Similarly, bar graphs are particularly effective at handling
ordinal data, allowing for a clear comparison across categories.

The dashboard's design follows Gestalt principles to provide coherent data presentation.
Figures grouped by proximity allow easy data comparison. Consistent colors and design across
the dashboard create a cohesive narrative, reflecting similarity. Section divisions through
headings and subtle shading exhibit enclosure. Line graphs with minimal aesthetics ensure
closure, unifying the visual field. Line graphs also maintain continuity, guiding readers through
data sequences. Strategic visual hierarchy and color contrast effectively illustrate the time series
data, underscoring the dashboard's analytical utility.

The dashboard is designed to provide important insights to real estate analysts who
monitor the housing market in Texas. The comprehensive line graph allows analysts to identify
long-term trends, cyclical patterns, and anomalies like recessions. Interactive elements enable
analysts to view detailed data snapshots. The bar charts make seasonal price variations clear,
which is essential for creating accurate investment strategies for optimal buying and selling
times. The third section of the dashboard focuses on supply and demand dynamics, where trends
in listings indicate potential price changes, and sales data reflect consumer confidence and
market demand. The turnover rate graph further reveals volatility between demand and supply.
The dashboard is enhanced with filters, allowing analysts to conduct focused analyses on specific
locations or timeframes for precise and informed reports.

The dashboard visualizations provide a comprehensive story of the Texas housing
market's performance and trends. They not only display historical sales volumes, highlighting the
market's highest and lowest points that correspond to economic events, but also show the
seasonality in prices, providing insights into the market's behavior during time periods. The
supply trend graph indicates the market's responsiveness, while the sales graph reflects consumer
confidence and demand. The turnover rate adds another layer of information, showing the
market's pace and efficiency. Together, these visual elements tell a story of a dynamic market
influenced by time and external factors, providing an analyst with a rich, data-driven narrative of
the past and present to forecast the future.
